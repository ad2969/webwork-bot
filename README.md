# webwork-bot
This bot uses javascript code to apply brute force in answering webwork questions.
Warning: The use of this bot may cause over +100 attempts easily, which may be obvious to examiners.

Due to the need for page reloading every submit, the code works by being injected into the browser's console every reload.

V1 of the code uses a browser extension called "tampermonkey"
  (which can be downloaded from https://tampermonkey.net/)
  in order to run and inject the script into the browser console on every reload.
  
The author is and will not be responsible for the misuse of the script.
